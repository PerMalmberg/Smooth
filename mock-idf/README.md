# mock-idf

Mock-idf is a minimal mock of Espressif's ESP-IDF framework that allows Smooth-based applications to build on Linux
without while still referencing IDF headers and functions etc. Only the bare minimum is mocked.

Note: This is a **mock**, not a simulator, so don't expect things like I2C to actually give you back data.
